# W11ISOPatcher
Windows 11 ISO patcher.

## Requirements
### Running
This program only officially supports Windows 10 May 2020 Update (version 2004) or newer.

### Building
Requires .NET 6 Preview Windows Desktop SDK and Visual Studio 2019 Preview or Visual Studio 2022 Preview.

### ISO
This program currently only works for x64 machines. I might add ARM64 support (but to be honest, pretty much all ARM64 devices meet system requirements).
